/// ServiceCollectionExtensions contains extension methods for IServiceCollection,
/// providing a centralized way to register application-specific services and their dependencies.
///
/// This class follows the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern to promote loosely coupled code.
/// By adding services to the IServiceCollection, they can be injected into controllers or other services at runtime,
/// allowing for more modular and testable code.
///
/// To add a new service:
/// 1. Define the service interface and implementation.
/// 2. Add a new services.AddScoped, services.AddTransient, or services.AddSingleton call here,
///    depending on the desired service lifetime (Scoped, Transient, or Singleton).
/// 3. Specify the service interface and implementation as generic type parameters.
///
/// Once services are registered here, they can be injected into constructors throughout the application.
